"Look at me", Tsubasa said to Marth who was still looking down. Still confused and a little pissed off, Marth decided to look up.

Tsubasa's face had lost it's regular stern look. She had relaxed again, and her blushing was back as well. Marth still wasn't sure what had gotten into her, and his hands continued to hover beside her armored torso.

Tsubasa stared into Marth's eyes, and she looked concerned. "Marth, I'm only eight years older than you." She said, trying her hardest to hold back emotion. Marth seemed to have hit a nerve. 

"I... I'm sorry." Although this situation still wasn't making sense, Marth tried to patch things up. His face was so close to Tsubasa's, it was like they were about to...

"Marth", Tsubasa said, as her face became flushed. She moved in close, and whispered in his ear.

"Hold me?"

Some sort of flag went up in Marth's head. Steam seemed to escape from his nose and ears as Marth's face matched Tsubasa's. Dinner, and some quality one on one time with a mature woman in his dorm. "BINGO!", Marth yelped as he finally granted permission to his hovering arms to go in for a feel. His fingers writhed for a moment and he let out an awkward chuckle. He wrapped his arms all the way around Tsubasa, reaching until his hands made it back around to her front.

*Ping*, a sound was heard as Marth's hands touched nothing but metal.

"Tsubasa, you're wearing metal armor...", Marth said as her clothing got in the way.

Tsubasa's expression changed again, her eyes looking down at Marth in an evil way. She looked at the ceiling with an mischievous grin to match, before rocking her head forward to deal a concussive headbutt to Marth's forehead, sending him into darkness.

Marth awoke, laying on his bed of burlap potato sacks. Tsubasa-sensei was still in the room, leaning against the wall near the door. She wore a smirk on her face, and floating above her hand was a rotating micro compact disk.

"What did you see in your Astral Realm when you were at the mine?", Tsubasa-sensei demanded.

"Why did you hit me? Ow!", Marth held his head, aching from the headbutt he had received. "How long was I out?", he asked as he sat up in bed.

Tsubasa-sensei looked troubled, standing up straight, gripping her fist as the micro compact disk faded into another realm.

"I don't think you understand the situation. You're my prisoner, and I'm interrogating you. I'm the one asking questions now.", Tsubasa set the ground rules.

"Sensei, I don't understand, you were just hugging me!", Marth was reaching his maximum mindfuckery.

"An act, so you would let your guard down. It's easier to inject you with my Astral Projection when you're at ease."

Marth felt like he had just been taken advantage of. Violated by a teacher.

"You're a teacher at this school! Surely you just broke some kind of social contract between student and teacher?"

Tsubasa-sensei looked excited as Marth made his case, her eyes lit up. "Oh yes, and you went along with it, even enjoyed it!", She laughed mischeviously. "But aren't you forgetting?", Tsubasa sensei paused with a smile. "You aren't a student here."

Marth knew she was right, and damn, was she spot on. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity to get pushed around and teased by a smoking hot teacher, chest armor or not.

"So what did you do inside my head?", Marth got to the point.

"I needed to see what you had stashed away in there. Now I know _everything_. From your cheating on the test to the double clock in your so-called hidden cave.", Tsubasa-sensei talked large. "I know everything, but I want to hear it from you. Why did you use Nemesis of Time during the entrance exam?"

Marth didn't know what to say. Did Tsubasa-sensei just pick up where Aldo-sensei had left off? Was Marth's execution about to be rescheduled? Tsubasa-sensei seemed to be much brighter than Aldo, saner too, so maybe things would work out if he just told the truth.

"Tsubasa-sensei, I..."

Tsubasa-sensei began to laugh. Nothing like Aldo's hysterical laughs, but more like a friend laughing at their buddy who just spilled juice on themselves.

"Tsubasa-sensei?", Marth was speechless again.

"You should have seen the look on your face!", Tsubasa-sensei continued laughing, slapping her leg and pointing at Marth. "Priceless! I should have brought a camera!"

"Tsubasa-sensei?", Marth asked again, and started to wonder if Tsubasa wasn't sane after all.

Tsubasa-sensei calmed herself down. "You are just adorable! Don't worry little buddy, I saw everything, you're in the clear!"

Marth was so over it. This teacher's insane just like the rest of them.

"You old hag! Where the hell do you get off? Seducing me, knocking me out, working me up like that, what the hell is wrong with you?!"

Tsubasa-sensei laughed more, and some moments passed before the two settled down. Tsubasa-sensei crossed her arms and spoke.

"The hidden cave you mentioned. You didn't put that there, someone else did.", Tsubasa-sensei explained, as Marth's interest piqued. "Inside the cave were the blueprints for Nemesis of Time, manifested as a two-faced golden desktop clock."

Suddenly things were starting to make sense to Marth. "Aldo-sensei could have put it there, when he Astral Projected my conscious into his own!"

Tsubasa-sensei closed her eyes and shook her head. "No, it wasn't Aldo-sensei. Aldo-sensei may be a maniac, but he's not the type to scheme. He was being honest about your use of Nemesis of Time. You really did use it."

"I did not! I used Hyper Dragon Ey... I mean I used Remote View.", Marth had to get defensive again.

"Yes, you did use Remote View to cheat on the exam, but at the same time, you unknowingly cast Nemesis of Time as a _proxy_ for someone else.", Tsubasa-sensei kept her arms crossed, opening her eyes and looking at Marth.

"That's impossible!", Marth was shocked at what he'd just heard.

"Impossible?", Tsubasa-sensei raised her eyebrows.

Marth thought a moment, remembering everything he had seen during the past few days. Injecting another consciousness into one's own. A body-less person. Planes of existences within a plane of existence. Girls who payed attention to him. As an Esper, the concept of impossible was obsolete.

"I suppose this is possible.", Marth conceded.

Tsubasa-sensei smiled.

"Now that we're on the same page, we can move on to the next order of business." Tsubasa-sensei unfolded her arms and walked over to Marth.

"Are you going to kill me?", Marth leaned back, not knowing what she was about to do.

"No, dummy. If I wanted you dead, I would have let Aldo do the job.", She said as she walked over to Marth, grasping both his hands with her own and bringing them near her heart. Marth leaned back further so she wouldn't get too close this time. "I need to teach you a thing or two about safe hex!"

Marth pulled his hands away from Tsubasa-sensei's, reeling back. "As if, you old hag! Like I'd want to take advice like that from you!", Marth had had enough with this woman's teasing and he turned away.

Tsubasa-sensei chuckled some more.

"If I'm to get to the bottom of this mystery, I need your full cooperation. Otherwise I might just let Aldo kill you!", She said as she raised her arms in the air, closing her eyes with a smile.

"I might just go ask Aldo to kill me so I can be free of you!", Marth saw through her bluff, assuming more teasing. 

"Oh my!" Tsubasa-sensei was having a blast as she laughed before resuming her serious conversation. "I have a theory. Whoever used you as a proxy for Nemesis of Time is likely doing so to hide their presence from the Academy."

"So that's why you haven't killed me yet.", Marth was starting to figure her out.

"It's just a theory, don't press your luck!", Tsubasa snapped back with a grin. "They've stashed the instructions for Nemesis of Time in your subconsciousness, which mean's they'll probably return to make use of you again. I want to watch you, and catch them when they try."

"So I'm your bait? I'm already your slave. Give me a break.", Marth exhaled with a sigh.

"That's right! Be a good slave for me and bait out the evil Esper!", Tsubasa-sensei proposed her plan, lifting her arms like a preacher spreading gospel.

Marth sat in silence as he considered his options, wondering if he even had any. 

"What if I say no?"

"I might have to buy a whip! I can't have you wandering the campus unsupervised, knowing you may project Nemesis of Time at any moment." Tsubasa-sensei got excited about the thought. "Ooo, what colour whip? Black or white?" Tsubasa-sensei was revealing her true colors.

Marth now understood the situation; he had no choice. Biting the bullet, Marth got back on Tsubasa's track.

"Why do I need to learn about safe hex? I'm not a mage", Marth wondered aloud.

"Oooh!" Tsubasa-sensei showed her excitement as she clapped her hands.

"Remember my X-cancelling Astralphones? We need to make one for you, so no more dirty Espers bore holes in your Ass-tral Realm!" Tsubasa-sensei was overjoyed as she spoke the line, laughing at the top of her lungs.

Marth sat expressionless as he wished he could just die. This teacher might just be more of a hopeless deviant than he.

---

Morning came, and Marth felt refreshed. The night before, Tsubasa-sensei had assisted Marth in creating X-cancelling Astralphones which would prevent further injections into Marth's consciousness.

"Pillar-grade defense barriers. Hell yeah." The thought of the teachers at this school no longer being able to get inside Marth's head made him feel good.

"It's too bad we had to create an exception in the X-cancelling protocol."

Indeed, Tsubasa-sensei saw it necessary that the original Esper who used Marth as a proxy for Nemesis of Time still be able to access Marth's Astral Realm. Without Admirite, Marth would have no way of detecting the Esper's intrusion, so that job was left to Tsubasa-sensei.
