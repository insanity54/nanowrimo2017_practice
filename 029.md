"Tsubasa, how many am I to make?" Crouched in front of his stack of blank cards, marth looked up at his teacher.

"Place cards are your main ammunition. Any projections made on the fly are only reserves. Therefore, you should always enter a battle with as many as you can carry."

"As many as I can carry? These cards are pretty light, but with enough stacks, they might start to encumber my gait."

"That's where a 3 day pack comes in handy." Tsubasa gestured towards the pack in the distance she had abandoned before their sparring match.

"What good is a pack if you're not hauling it?" Marth looked at it's rigid blue and white cloth.

"As the name implies, the pack is large enough to carry supplies sufficient for three days of survival. It's heavy, so it's not suited for combat. The best way to use it is to stash it at a base camp before fighting, returning to it as needed to resupply your on-person inventory."

"So that's why you unclipped your belt from your pack before we fought. But what if the opponent finds your pack? Any extra Place Cards stored within would be sweet loot for an enemy!"

"Right. It's best to hide it." Tsubasa offered a solution.

"With camoflage?" Marth wondered.

"Camoflage is a poor method in most cases. Remember your opponent will be other Espers. Using Remote View, they could easily scout out the position of your camp, and the contents within. It's best to hide the entire camp on another plane, out of sight from Remote Viewers."

"A Plane Shift for concealment? Sensei, I can't do that!" Marth looked bewildered.

"As expected. Luckily, most of your opponents are in the same boat; they haven't learned Planar Shift yet."

"Wait, can you teach me?" Marth saw an opportunity for an edge.

"Unfortunately, no. We don't have the time. You will need to win this competition using other means."

"You said most of my opponents haven't learned Planar Shift. Do you mean to say that there are some who do know it?" Marth stood up from his crouched position.

"Yes, a few third years do know it."

"What if they shift me into another plane, and leave me there? I'll be trapped, as good as eliminated!"

"It should be fine, Marth. As long as you keep your distance from them, they can't shift you with them."

"Oh great, another element of complexity. Don't get close to the other competitors."

"Remember before, when you tried to get up close for a sure to hit Resonant Wave?"

"Yes, you kept jumping away."

"It's called kiting."

"Kiting? Meaning your evasions were as if to tell me to go fly a kite?"

Tsubasa smiled.

"My movements were as the outline of a kite. I held my position at a point in the kite's outline. Then, I moved quickly to another point, where I held my position. During a fight, holding position gives me the opportunity to project. After the projection is created, I immediately move, maintaining space between my pursuer and I."

"If you're using ranged attacks and your pursuer has only melee attacks, they would never be able to hit you!" Marth blurted out his interpretation.

"Precicely. Kiting plays on the strengths of my ranged projections, while minimizing my exposure to the opponent's close range attacks."

"It seems kind of cheap to me." Marth pouted again.

"This isn't Final Fantasy, Watanabe." Tsubasa shook her head. "Having turns and taking hits isn't going to get you anywhere you want to be. Winning is always about gaining the upper hand, honorable or not."

"Geez, sensei. When you put it that way, being an Esper doesn't seem so glorious."

With eyes closed, Tsubasa exhaled deeply before speaking.

"Being an Esper means choosing a side and honoring ideals. Our battles may be for the right reasons, but that doesn't change the fact that we take lives. It's dirty work, I feel no glory in it." 

"This doesn't make sense." Marth put his hand on his chin. "Most stories of Espers are bristling with a sense of righteousness, duty, and strength. But you're telling me you don't feel a sense of accomplishment?"

"I feel renowned and honored by those who do not fight, but I do not feel encouraged from it. Killing others, seeing my friends be killed... In Esper combat where a gruesome death can be as simple as a thought, there isn't a split second to consider honor or your own humanity. War makes me ill."

"Tsubasa..." Marth looked at his teacher sympathetically. "I didn't know."

Tsubasa looked at the ground for a few moments before shaking her head and laughing.

"I lost track of time. It's almost 10PM already! I think this is a good point to call it a day."

Marth looked up at the sky, the bright sun shining down from the green sky. 

"Oh yeah, I almost forgot. 24/7 sunshine on this planet!" So busy with his training, Marth hadn't though to check the time all day.
