March sat on his potato sack bed as the morning light shone through the base of the supply closet door. Marth looked at the door, expecting Tsubasa to come knocking at any moment. Minutes passed in silence, and Marth began to wonder.

"Where is she? Tsubasa-sensei is usually punctual.", Marth quickly ate his words as he remembered how her suppressed personality didn't match her rigid appearance. More minutes passed and Marth quit wondering if something had happened, and settled on the theory that she was just messing with him.

"Well, it can't be helped", Marth said as he stretched his arms. "I'm not about to sit in a potato sack bed all day."

Marth got dressed in his work uniform and left his room. As he closed the door to the supply closet, the golden stained glass windows across the hall let in a beautiful shimmering light. 

"The past few days, Tsubasa-sensei stands there, blocking the light and barking orders for the day. It's nice to have a chance to enjoy the view."

Marth looked down the hall, looking for students exiting their rooms, but saw none. It seemed a little strange that he was alone in the dorm hallway in the morning.

"The schedule!", Marth figured students must be off to classes already. "Did I sleep in that long?", Marth thought yesterday's work may have taken more of a toll on his body than he had thought.

Marth ran to the end of the hallway and down the stairs, reaching the foyer of the dormitory. Marth found a large clock on the wall.

"9:59AM!", Marth was shocked to see he had slept in so late. It didn't help that his room had no windows to let light in, and no alarm other than Tsubasa's fist on the door. Thinking of the teacher, Marth was just realizing the worst part.

"I missed breakfast!", Marth cried to the heavens, arms tensing up. Breakfast here was the best, with perfectly ripened fruits, expertly crafted museli, and a variety of freshly baked breads. The thought of such a feast on an empty stomach made him keel over in agony.

The large clock struck 10, ushering in a new hour as it's gentle Westminster chime echoed throughout the room. Warm sun rays beamed down through the front windows, casting shadows on the maroon colored carpet and illuminating the stylish granite walls. It was Monday, the first day of a new quarter. "That explains Tsubasa-sensei's absense. Surely an initiation ceremony is just wrapping up, and home room will be starting soon." Marth fantasized about participating in the ceremony, or being assigned a home room. Just wearing the uniform would be enough to put a smile on his face, but instead, he stood alone in the dormitory's entrance hall wearing a worker's uniform.

"The uniform?", Marth looked down at his attire, navy blue with sky blue vertical stripes on the chest. This wasn't cool at all, unless one's idea of cool was a utilitarian superlative of stain resistance and deep pockets. "The first day of academy, and I'm wearing _this_.", Marth was becoming a downer to himself. All the years he had spent dreaming of coming here to train and become a great Esper, were quickly crumbling into a forced career of lackluster manual labor. He didn't feel like an Esper at all, he felt like a tool.

"This isn't my dream." Marth gritted his teeth, refusing to accept the reality before him. "Did Tsubasa-sensei expect me to just show up in the kitchen to work? I'm a prisoner, not a employee!" Marth saw a golden opportunity before him.

"Tsubasa-sensei's too busy to put me to work, that's not my problem!" I can't become a Esper if I'm spending all my time doing someone else's dirty work!

Marth closed his eyes, seeing himself in his Astral realm. "Get rid of that stupid uniform!", Marth yelled, tearing away the work uniform from his astral body, disintegrating it within his mind. Standing with only trunks and socks, Marth saw a perfect canvas to work with. Drawing from his memories of student attire, Marth reached for the concept and drew in the image of the academy's standard attire.

White trousers, white long sleeve shirt with a yellow tie. A matching crisp white outer jacket with a large emblem on the back, blue stripes down the sleeves, blue accents near the chest pockets, and white gloves. Marth's astral representation of himself spun as the individual pieces of the suit were summoned and applied to his body. He stood there with a smirk, inspecting his new clothing created with Atomic Relegation, the same projection used to craft a giant pickaxe the day before.

Atomic Relegation does not summon something from nothing, as that would violate the natural laws of thermodynamics. Rather, Atomic Relegation requires raw materials from somewhere. The ground nearby, the projector's body, a different Astral plane, all are valid places for raw materials. In the mine, plenty of iron was in rocks in the ground. Wood for the handle was easily created by rearranging carbon and oxygen molecules from the earth and air.

Opening his eyes, Marth brought the Astral creation into reality, he stood there wearing the school's student uniform. His work uniform served as the raw resources, and it's makeup was completely re-arranged to suit suit.

Now Marth was armed with the proper attire, next he had to sneak into a classroom. "I did a week of work in a day, so I deserve it anyway". He rationalized. Although he was a prisoner, he was present on the campus of his desires. Although he was a rejected student, he was a student none the less.

"Aint nobody gunna stop me from attending classes.", Marth contested his situation as he walked through the front door of the dormitory. Students were seen in the distance exiting the auditorium. Armed with his clever disguise, Marth jogged to catch up and blend in with the crowd.

Dozens of smiling students walked to different parts of campus to attend their home room class. New faces were all around and a congenial chatter was present. Marth tailed a group headed to the west most building on campus, the Incorporeal Science building. It was on the highest grounds of the school and had a modern look. Steel framed, with an exterior accented with dark stone. Splitting into several smaller groups, Marth followed the largest looking crowd into a laboratory classroom, taking a seat near the back.

Marth's seat was next to a window, and from there he could see beyond the school grounds. From the building's height, a gentle green slope descended to a narrow river, and past that, a forest. Beyond the forest was Marth's home city, barely visible past the dense woods. It was there that Marth would look up at St. Ezreal's, and dream about the heroes who were cultured there. Marth was off in fantasy land and he barely noticed a girl sit at the chair next to him.

"I don't believe this. _This_ man is in our same class? It is as if the school administration wants to bring me down!". The loud complaint was heard from the familiar voice. Marth cringed as he turned from the window to look at Tanaka Aoi. She sat there, turned in her seat, hunching over and glaring at Marth. Her long brown hair was pinned at both sides, showing her forehead, and she was wearing the School's white uniform for the first time. The girl's uniforms were way cute. White tulip skirts that accentuated their hips, along with a sky blue blouse, yellow bow tie, and a white button up jacket.

"That uniform really suits you, Tanaka! It shows off your figure way better than your old school uniform.", Marth jested, throwing Aoi into a fit.

"Right off the bat? This man has no shame!", Aoi's face turned red and she stood up to join the platinum blonde Shizuma Miyu. Miyu's eyes looked curiously down at Marth.

"What luck that the three of us end up in the same home room!", Shizuma Miyu spoke.

Marth chuckled a bit, "Yeah what a coincidence!"

The two girls walked to the middle of the classroom, taking a seat together at a vacant table.

Some time passed and a teacher walked into the room. Luckily, it was one that hadn't met Marth yet. The teacher began role call, and Marth started sweating. If he couldn't pose as a student, he may not have another chance to attend classes. One after another, the student's names were called.

"Kato, Amane?"

"Here."

"Kobayashi, Inoue?"

"Here."

Marth hoped for some miracle, that his facade wouldn't be blown away in the first day.

"Matsumoto, Shuu?"

Silence swept the room, and the teacher asked again.

"Matsumoto, Shuu? Are you here?"

"HERE!", Marth yelped, taking the chance, hoping that no other students were an acquaintance to the real Shuu.

His loud announcement drew the looks of his peers, especially from Aoi and Miyu.

"Shit! They know my real name!", Marth cursed under his breath.

The rest of the class reported their presence, and the teacher introduced themselves to the class. Afterwards, the teacher gave the time to the students to mingle and offer their own introductions to each other.

Tanaka Aoi came over to Marth right away.

"Hey, Shuu, how's it going, buddy?", She began, playing along. Shizuma Miyu tailed along, standing at Aoi's shoulder as she played Ms. nice gal.

Shizuma joined the conversation, although a little slowly. "Does Watanabe Marth have four parents?"

Marth looked up at Tanaka Aoi's grinning face. She held that expression for a moment longer before switching to the loud and obnoxious Tanaka Aoi he knew.

"Matsumoto, Shuu???! I knew something was off with you! It's not enough to be a pervert stalker, you also have to be a scheming liar! And after you acted all cool in the cafeteria the other day. You really are the worst!", Tanaka said, throwing another fit.

"Aoi, they're looking!", Shizuma said as she tugged on Aoi's sleeve. The other students were staring as Tanaka caused a commotion.

Tanaka Aoi quickly composed herself, joining her hands together near her waist. "It's very nice to meet you, Matsumoto Shuu!", she said with a happy expression. It was like she was a different person, but Marth could see she was just trying to keep up appearances.

"Tell me, Watanabe, I mean Matsumoto, what subjects will you be studying this quarter?", She asked joyfully, pausing with a smile to let Marth reply.
