A moment passed and Marth heard some fumbling behind the door, followed by a girl's voice.

"Just a minute!".

More fumbling was heard, then a loud thud. Someone had just fallen and Marth's uncontrollable help-a-girl-heroism kicked in, turning the doorknob, and swinging open the door.

Concerned, Marth barged through the threshold, blurting out, "Are you OK?" Marth stood there, doorknob in hand, looking down at a pink long-haired girl sitting on the floor, holding her head.

"Ow ow ow", the girl spoke as she winced her eyes. Under her hand was a yellow headband, and she wore a matching color knitted sweater. Her sweater reached the tatami mat where she sit, and Marth couldn't tell whether or not she was wearing any bottoms. Her long tone legs were in clear view, next to a basket of yarn which was tipped over at her bare feet.

The girl looked up curiously at Marth, revealing her low-cut sweater and even lower-cut white blouse underneath. Marth looked away, trying not to stare at her chest, and blushed.

"Um", he said while the girl seemed unaware that her girls were showing.

"Welcome!", the girl said, ignoring her pain for a moment and letting out a big smile. "I tripped over the table." She said, sitting up straight. Her sweater lifted enough to reveal short lounge shorts, and finally Marth noticed the coffee table behind her with pieces of fabric spread over it.

"Do you make clothes?", Marth asked, putting the two together.

"Yes! It's just about the only thing I'm good at.", The girl said, placing her hand over her heart and the yellow knitted sweater.

Marth remembered his manners, taking his hand off the door and bowing. "Please forgive me for intruding. My name's Marth, I've been assigned to this building."

"I'm Miyagi, Riko, 4th year" She said with a smile. She approached marth, grasping his hand with both of hers. "nice to meet you!" The world seemed to go rosy and Marth couldn't stop his face from turning red.

Just then, the sound of bed sheets sliding was heard, and coming out of hiding in the top bunk in the room, another girl sat up and threw a book aside.

"Riko, get away from that man!"

The girl looked about the same age as Miyagi, her hair short blue, with dark blue eyes. She descended down the bunk bed ladder, wearing a T-shirt and sweatpants.

"What is it, Hanna?", Miyagi asked the blue haired girl.

"Check the Astral net. This man is not a student. He does not deserve your respect.", Hanna put it coldly.

"Hey wait a minute, there's been a misunderstanding, I could use at least a little respect.", Marth said in his defense.

"Marth, I'm Sato Hanna, dorm manager. I'll show you to your quarters now. And next time you come to this room, make sure you knock before entering.", Sato said, her eyes seeming to pierce through Marth's soul.

"Hanna-chan!", Miyagi seemed concerned about the tone Sato had taken.

The three walked down the hall, leaving the girl's section. Marth realized there wasn't mixed dorms after all, and let out a sigh.

"Marth, this is your room.", Sato announced. Marth looked at the direction indicated, looking for a dorm door. Instead, a closet labelled, "storage" lied ahead.

"Nani!??!", Marth yelped, and Miyagi seemed to reel as well.

"Is this the right place?" Miyagi worried.

Sato opened the door, showing the minimal accommodation. A shelf with cleaning supplies, some stacked cardboard boxes, and a corner full of empty potato sacks. Damn potatoes. That virgin newfag Kaito must have been the one behind this.

"Wait a minute, I'm expected to make a bed out of potato sacks?, This is just inhumane!”

"Don't do the crime if you don't got the time", Sato said as she turned to leave.

Miyagi stayed, holding her hands to her chin.

"Is he going to be alright?", she said with concern.

"Riko, we're leaving.", Sato commanded.

Miyagi stood, staring at Marth briefly. A moment passed as Marth stood next to the ammonia based spray cleaners in the dimlit room. He wasn't about to look weak in front of a girl, so he let out a laugh.

"Hahaha, this is nothing, It's like camping in the barn at my grandparent's place!", he made up the story as he sat down on the sacks. There were enough of them to be firm, and he thought it might not be so bad after all.

Miyagi smiled, joining her hands behind her back. "Breakfast is at 7, come join us!", and with that she left.

Marth kicked back, recounting the day's events. The fifth pillar of St. Ezreal's accused Marth of a projection he didn't create. The first pillar of St. Ezreal's lectured him on the projection he didn't create, yet didn't kill him. Could there have been another student in the lecture hall who cheated as well? Did the idiot Aldo-sensei accuse the wrong cheater? Marth had so many unanswered questions. He drifted off to sleep and couldn't help but dream of potato beetles.

Marth awoke to a knocking at his door. 

"Five more minutes, onae-chan." Tired and groggy, Marth didn't remember where he was.

The door burst open and Tsubasa-sensei walked in. In her hands she carried a set of blue work clothes. She tossed the clothes ontop of Marth as he laid in bed.

"Get dressed." Tsubasa-sensei told Marth, her voice jolting him from his slumber. "you have two minutes."

"What is this!?", Marth had expected the Academy would provide a school uniform, not a work uniform.

Tsubasa waited outside as Marth got dressed. The uniform's fabric was a stiff blue cotton, with a few vertical stripes on the long sleeve shirt. Marth cheekily grabbed a spray bottle on the way out of the supply closet and breached the door like something from an action flick, kicking open the door then rushing out into the hall, looking down the sights of the sprayer.

"Clear!”, Marth yelled mischievously.

Tsubasa-sensei rewarded Marth with a chop to the head. "Let's get going, you've got a long day ahead of you."

Marth followed Tsubasa-sensei down the hall in silence, watching other students as they walked from their dorms to begin their day. Marth remembered Miyagi-chan.

"Hey, sensei, what time is it? I don't want to miss breakfast."

"Oh don't worry, you won't miss it."

The two walked to the mess hall. A large area with a brick vaulted ceiling, the varying brick colors forming boxy patterns. The asthetic reminded Marth of a cave carved out of a mountain, although he knew it was just a regular campus building on the outside. A few tables were occupied by students using the space to study and sip their morning beverages. A kitchen staff could be heard prepping the meal, and Tsubasa-sensei guided him straight for the kitchen.

"I've got a bad feeling about this", Marth muttered to himself as he read 5:58 from a large clock.

"Have you brought me a hard worker, Tsubasa-sensei?", A heavy set man wearing a chef hat asked.

"The hardest worker you'll ever know", Sensei replied. "If he doesn't live up to that expectation, let me know immediately."

Marth gritted his teeth as the chef laughed.

"Oh I'm looking forward to this! I'm Adish, head chef. Please do your best!", He said as his big belly bounced with joy.

"I'm in your care", Marth said with a bow.

He spent the morning swapping out oil in the deep friers, de-icing large refrigerators, and peeling potatoes.

"Damn that virgin newfag Kaito."

Breakfast was served to the masses of students, after which Adish released Marth for a break. Helping himself to the breakfast leftovers, Marth sat down at a table and dug in. He practically inhaled a large stack of waffles with strawberries and maple syrup. With time still on the clock for his break, he looked around the cafeteria for the chance to meet Miyagi before he had to head back.

Visiting each table in the large room, Miyagi was nowhere to be found. With a few minutes left of break, he sat down at a table, defeated. Marth's eye drew to another worker as she wiped down a table. Past her, a group of students was seen in the commons area checking posted exam scores from the day before. That's right, those students got to go home after the exam yesterday, and Marth was stuck here on the impromptu prisoner work program.

Two girls jumped for joy as they read their ID numbers from the passing list.

"Good for them", Marth mumbled as he stretched his arms. The large breakfast had made him sleepy and he put his head down on the table to rest his eyes. "They will be getting the actual school uniform, and get to start classes next week." Little did he know that he had drawn attention to himself as his arms were in the air.

"What the hell are you doing here?" The familiar voice asked as she stormed over to the resting Marth. His morning had just gone from bad to worse, now that this annoying cat girl knew of his presence.

Marth didn't want to raise his head for the continuation of yesterday's argument, so he just waved her away, face buried in his arms.

"Move along, nothing to see here, just a man taking his work break."

A vein seemed to pop on Tanaka Aoi's forehead, her face wrenching in anger.

"At least address me properly, you inconsiderate bastard!", She said as she got physical, grabbing the back of Marth's head and pressing it into the table. Marth's arms tensing in the air.

"Oww! What gives?" Marth cried
