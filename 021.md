Marth had returned the trays from his table and left the cafeteria. With the mysterious girl's binoculars in his book bag, Marth passed by the yard. The water from the fountains was glistening in the sun beyond the tall hedges. With the administration building to his right, Marth glanced over, wondering about the teacher he had carried there.

Marth looked to the Astral Science Studies building, the same building he had taken the entrance exam from. 

"The auditorium is so large..." Marth's plan for the next period was forming.

Marth continued his walk to the building, turning onto it's wide concrete path lined with cherry blossom trees on either side. A handful of students converged at the glass doorways, one by one holding the door open for the student behind.

Inside the foyer was an elevator, retrofitted to the building's legacy structure. A hallway stretched from left to right, leading to stairs and the building's four large audauditoriums. Martdecided to revisit the same room which he had taken the test, the last door down the left hall. Throught he door, other students were taking their seats. Marth took the first available seat, sitting down and placing his book bag on the floor.

Marth remembered this auditorium. Tiered seating, with long wooden desks spanning entire rows. The desks had intricate carvings, representing the school's iconic pillars. Tall stained glass windows let in light through their translucent surfaces.

The large student audience was the perfect cover. No role was called in this room, and Marth blended in perfectly. Marth took notes as the sensei drew diagrams on the chalkboard at the head of the room.

The period came to an end, and Marth relocated to another auditorium in the same building. Blending in with the crowd once again, Marth sat through a lecture in which the instructor explained ethics in the Astral realm.

"The nuances between reality and personal reality may feel minute, but it is up to the individual to educe their own personal reality which aligns with the honor code set in place by St. Ezreal. Property rights, including that of self ownership, must be observed at all times and shall not be infringed. Thus, it would behoove all students to refrain from such acts of impersonation, plagurism, and defamation."

Marth took notes, careful to not misspell any of the large words.

The period ended and Marth switched auditoriums once again.

"Molecular stucture is important to project accurately." The lecturer droned.

"Here we can see an example of an Esperite molecule, and it's similarity to crystal Quartz. The former can be refined to form beneficial products for Espers, while the latter has little practical use to that end. Thus, accuracy is key to molecular synthesis."

The lecture concluded and Marth left the building, bag in hand.

"My brain hurts!", Marth complained about the long winded presentations. "Note to self. Next time, spread the lectures throughout the day!"

Marth walked past the cherry blossoms towards the dormitory.

"Time for a break!" he rationalized skipping out on what would be the final period of the day.

Marth hopped up the foyer stairs, speed walked down the hall, and opened the door to his room. With his mind crammed full of new information, the potato sacks on the floor never seemed so inviting.

Marth tossed his bag on a utility shelf, and plopped face down on the sacks. He exhaled into the bags before turning his head to one side. Smiling, he closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep.

Marth dreampt of the messy haired girl in the cafeteria. The two of them were on a grassy hill in a field of tall grass, overlooking the school's campus. Both of them were dressed in camoflage uniforms, wearing laced up military boots and netted bulletproof helmets on their heads. Weaved between the netting were long bits of grass, forming a camoflage crown.

They were both on their bellies, laying side by side with their legs stretch out and feet flat on their sides against the ground. The girl held her olive drab green binoculars up against her eyes.

"Target sighted. 1250 meters." The girl spoke as she peered towards the campus through an opening in the tall grass.

Puzzled, Marth pushed the tall field grass to either side, trying to catch a glimpse at what she was talking about. 

"Here", the girl offered her binoculars.

"Thanks", Marth grabbed the specs, pressing them up against his face.

An elevated view of the campus shone through the lenses. The blacktop of the wide parking, the flat top of the commons building, littered with AC units, the fountains in the yard were clearly visible from this height, the tall hedges looking like miniscule plants from up here.

On the wide concrete walkway between the commons and the exam hall, a girl walked with her back to Marth with both hands grasping her book bag in front of her.

"The target?", Marth wondered aloud, pulling back from the binoculars and looking at the messy haired girl.

"Roger." The girl replied. This time, in her hands she held a large black collapsed umbrella with a hooked wooden handle, as if it were some kind of sniper rifle. Her right shoulder pressed up against the wooden handle's curve, and her left eye was squinted as she looked down the umbrella's shaft and past it's pointy cap. "Taking the shot!"

Marth watched in peak curiosity as a 8 bit video game sound emminated from the Umbrella's ferrule, accompanied by a pulse of a yellow beam of lazer light.

Marth quickly looked through the binoculars in his hands. The laser instantlty struck the hind quarters of the girl on the path, disintigrating her white mini skirt on impact.

"Ahhh!" The girl cried out as she covered her front with her book bag.

"Perfect shot!" The messy haired girl's face glowed as she looked at the skirtless girl through a second pair of binoculars. A smile on her face stretched from ear to ear.

"Wow! Bear print!" Marth eyed the low-cut pink panties with a brown teddy bear. He was getting into this game, as the long brown haired girl on the pathway crouched in embarrasement.

"Hey, hey, find me another target!" The skirt bursting girl asked of Marth.

"Eye, eye, captain!" Marth sat up straight to salute his pervy superior before snapping back to view through the binoculars. 

"1.3 kilometers. 10 o'clock low. Notable mirage, offset 12%", Marth called out the target.

"Mhm, mhm!" The messy haired girl nodded with a smirk as she adjusted her imaginary rifle scope. "Target aquired, taking the shot!"

A loud lazer zap burst through the air, as frightened nested birds took flight from the tall surrounding grass.

The lazer hit it's mark, zapping the white tulip from the girl's hips. As she walked facing the mischevious snipers with her bag at her side, her skirt seemed to disappear in slow motion, revealing...

"No panties!" The two yelled in unison, eyes tearing up and blood gushing from their nostrils. In the distance, the shocked girl with blonde curly hair and studious glasses, had a look of surprise as she dropping her bag and covered herself with both hands.

The two skirt snipers lay back, eyes glassed over and losing fountains of blood from the sight. As Marth lay there twitching, Something in his pants began to overheat.

"So smoothe!" Marth said with slurred speech as his pocket became hotter. Hotter and hotter, a burning sensation increased so much that Marth was jolted from his dream, the pain receptors in his leg inciting a twitch. 

Marth's eyes opened as he look down at the right pocket of his pant leg. It was glowing a hot white, and something inside was burning his thigh.

"Ow ow ow!" Marth sat up, unbuttoning his pants and pulling them down to the floor. Standing in his underwear atop the potato sacks, Marth grabbed the pants by the opening in the legs and shook wildly.

The place card from Yoshida-sensei fell out of the pants pocket and onto the floor. Lit up like a torch, the card burned a hot white. Marth grabbed a shoe and tried to stamp out the heat.

"What's going on?" Marth held his shoe in his hand as he it the card over and over. It's heat transferred into the floor, creating a black burning mark in the concrete. Marth remembered the projection stored in the card.

"Starry notif? Was this thing undergoing nuclear fusion in my pocket?!" In a panic, Marth looked around for something to handle the ablazed card.

From the utility shelves in the room, Marth found a metal pail and used his shoe to scoop the burning card inside. The rubber sole of his shoe letting off a whisp of smoke.

Marth slipped on his shoes and ran out the door and through the hallways, narrowly missing a couple girls as they walked down the stairs into the foyer.

Marth ran outside, and down the path towards the commons. Past the range, he turned down the path to the Administration building, hot pail in hand, it's metal bottom beginning to glow red.

Entering the building, Marth called out to the doctor. "Yoshida!"

Marth's view faded from the dark interior of the Administration buildiing to the bright medical ward.

Marth dropped the red hot pail holding the white hot card as it's heat travelled up the wire handle. Although the card was made of paper, it didn't seem to show any damage from the intense heat.

Yoshida-sensei looked over to Marth as the pail hit the floor with a echoey thud. She promptly rolled her chair away from the desk and stood up. 

"Marth-chan, What happened?!" 

"Starry notif happened!" Marth pointed to the pail with the glowing hot card. "Are you _trying_ to kill me?"

"My oh my!" Yoshida walked to the pail, staring down at the heated content.
