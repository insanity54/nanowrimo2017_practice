The sound of small footsteps drew near as Marth's jaw worked his food like a cow chewing a wad of grass.

"You there! I've been looking all over for you. Where on earth have you been?!" An girl's upset voice rang in Marth's ears.

With food still in his mouth, Marth opened one eye to see Tanaka Aoi with an angry expression. Hands on her hips Tanaka was bent over, leaning towards him. 

"Well, what do you have to say for yourself? Keeping a lady waiting, what gives?" Tanaka persisted.

Marth finished chewing his food and swallowed.

"I'm sorry, why are you here?" Marth was enjoying his peace and quiet up until now.

Tanaka looked surprised, and lessened her lean. "W.. w.. ww.. we..." Tanaka struggled to maintain eye contact as she spoke. She pressed her two index fingers together repeatedly.

"We... We had a date!" Tanaka blurted out as she turned red from embarrasement. "Don't tell me you forgot..." Tanaka slowly pressed her fingers together once again.

"A DATE!?" Marth tensed up in his seat, impacted by what he had just heard. His knees hit the underside of the table, knocking his plate and his chopsticks into the air.
