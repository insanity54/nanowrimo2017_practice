as he resisted Tanaka's push.

"Hmmph!", Tanaka let out, crossing her arms and turning her head as she closed her eyes.

"Geez, you've got too much energy in the morning", Marth said as he fixed his hair and rested his head once again.

Tanaka pretended not to care, but had to open one eye to peek at Marth to see why he was so gloomy. Shizuma Miyu walked up behind Tanaka Aoi.

"That uniform. Did this man get a job here?", Shizuma broke the silence, reminding Marth that he hadn't introduced himself to these two. Not that he could have, as their meetings prior were so brief and awkward.

Annoying or not, he was going to be seeing more of these two from now on, so it was a common courtesy to tell his name. Marth lifted his head.

"I am Watanabe Marth. It's been a little difficult since we met. How about we start over?", Marth started his diplomacy.

Shizuma Miyu nodded her head twice with a confirming, "mhm, mhm." 

Tanaka Aoi clenched up and looked away again, blushing a bit as she was thrown off by his congeniality. It only lasted for a moment and she faced Marth to yell.

"Don't think you can play nice guy, Mr. nice guy pants!", Tanaka struggled to make a comeback.

"Come on, Shizuma, let's get away from this creepy man and visit the school store.", she blurted, grabbing Shizuma's wrist. Shizuma seemed to have more to say, her mouth open as her green eyes looked at Marth as Tanaka dragged her away.

"What a bother.", Marth muttered to himself as he let out a sigh.

Marth spent the rest of the day assisting the kitchen staff, bussing tables, washing dishes, and cleaning. As the sun went down, Adish released Marth for the day.

"At least I won't go hungry.", Marth saw the silver lining as he thought about the large meals his work afforded him. But that alone wasn't enough to satisfy him. Marth had other plans that were being sidelined because of his captivity.

"I can't become an Esper if I have to work like this every day.", Marth was troubled as he walked down the campus path towards the dorms. As he turned a corner, he could see Sato Hanna taking a jog in the distance wearing a blue, white and yellow tracksuit. Even her workout clothes were color coordinated with the School.

"A healthy body makes a healthy mind", Marth quoted his parents. Espers especially need exercise to retain a clear mind. Luckily, the day's work had provided plenty of physical exercise. That reminded him, when was the last time he had created a projection? Just like muscles, Espers need practice or their skills dull. Marth figured this might be the only moment of freedom for the day, so he took the opportunity to walk over to one of the courtyard's fountains.

Resonant Wave, a basic projection which has hundreds of applications. Resonant Wave uses vibration to affect a target. Resonant Wave can create a sound when a target material vibrates fast enough to reach it's resonant frequency, or it can create heat as a result of target's accelerated particles.

Marth squared up to the fountain, pushing both his palms outward in front of him. Marth closed his eyes and saw his naked self in the Astral realm, holding the same position. In this realm, he created a summoning circle in front of his hands, with symbols representing sinewaves, particles, and random movement. He increased the size of the summoning circle to match the size of the fountain, and opened his eyes, merging his Astral realm's reality into his own. The summoning circle now was in the real world, and Marth focused on the fountain past his bare arms and blue translucent summoning circle. Marth spoke the words, "Resonant Wave, I project!" and the summoning circle vibrated considerably. Slowly, the temperature of the fountain's water began to increase.

"Let's turn you into some steamy hot steam!", Marth thought accelerating the water molecules would be good practice and he could tell from the bubbles that it was getting warmer. Just when Marth was getting ready to see steam rise from the display, he heard a girl yelp as if in pain. 

"AhhA!"

"Sato-senpai?", Marth called out as he broke down the summoning circle and began to run towards where he had seen her last. Did she fall? Marth wondered as he ran naked.

"Naked?", Marth looked down at himself, realizing what he had just done. In his projection of Resonant Wave, he envisioned himself naked in the Astral realm, before merging that personal reality with the real world. It's not always that Marth saw himself as naked in the Astral realm, but often the projector's true sense of self is projected there. In this new school and with all these new experiences, it's only natural that the creator feel naked and vulnerable inside.

"Damn, forgot to create clothing!", Marth cursed as he jumped behind a bush. As he did so, he saw Sato lying on the ground, tightly grasping herself.

Marth wanted to call out, but couldn't draw attention to himself as he hid there naked.

"So hot!", Sato cried as she pushed a hand between her legs, the other still around her chest.

Marth was confused. Did she overheat from running? Is she having a heart attack? Naked or not, if Sato-senpai was in danger, this was no time to be hiding. 

"Sato-senpai!", Marth jumped out from behind the bush, running towards his senior.

"It's cooling down?", Sato said as she opened her eyes, then looking up at the incoming Marth. All Sato Hanna could interpret from the sight of nude marth was the image of a charging elephant, it's large flailing trunk letting out a wild trumpet call.

Sato stood immediately and instinctively dealt a perfect roundhouse kick to Marth's face, sending him flying backwards. Marth floated through the air in what seemed like slow motion, and he finally understood the situation. He had Sato's athletic body on the mind, and in heating up the fountain he had also heated up her sweat. Under normal circumstances, he'd be happy to make a girl squeal, but this was Sato Hanna, 4th year student and dormitory manager. Marth's limp body hit the ground.

"So it was you?!", Sato said with rage in her eyes. This was bad. Marth was already living in the supply closet, now where would she send him?

"You are the most disgusting human being I have ever laid my eyes on.", Sato began. "Using Esper abilities to take advantage of a student, pardon me while I do your job and take out the trash!", she said with a fury. Marth had underestimated the punishment he would receive as Sato raised her hand and created a white summoning circle in front of her.

"She doesn't even need to close her eyes?", Marth hadn't realized what a 4th year Esper was capable of.

The sky went from dark to stormy, lightning striking the background as the wind picked up, blowing Sato's short dark hair and ruffling her tracksuit.

"Tell me, Marth, do you wish to die?", Sato asked as the world seemed to turn against Marth.

Was Sato Hanna the type of girl to kill out of spite? Marth, stunned and afraid, could only beg for his life. 

"I.. It's not what you think!", Marth pleaded. "It was an accident!"

Sato paused to consider his words, then closed her eyes. Marth seemed off the hook, until Sato opened her eyes a second later.

"Cosmic! Bind!", Sato yelled as a rope jettisoned from her summoning circle, wrapping tightly around Marth.

The sky cleared and Sato walked towards the dormitory, dragging the snared Marth behind ad the end of a length of rope.

"I can't breathe!", Marth complained as his bruised cheek was pulled against the ground, leaving a trail of drool behind.

"Serves you right.", Sato said as she continued her march, closing her eyes and resuming her stoic demeanor.

The two reached the dormitory and Marth was thrown into the supply closet, still bound by the ropes. Sato slammed the door and went off to her room, leaving Marth to his quiet room and potato sack bed.

"Damn Kaaaiiiitooooo!"

Marth awoke to a knock at his door. It was morning and Tsubasa-sensei had returned to see him off to work. The ropes from the night before had loosened, allowing Marth to shake free. 

"I need another uniform", Marth said through the door before Tsubasa could enter.

Tsubasa-sensei fetched another uniform from the Astral warehouse, blindly tossing it through the doorway.

"Today you will be mining Admirite. Get dressed."

The two left the dorm building and headed towards the administration building. It was early morning the same as yesterday, but no students seemed to be out and about. Marth fondly remembered what it was like to sleep in on Saturday.

"I didn't know the school had a mine.", Marth spoke his mind.

"The school doesn't. It's on another plane.", sensei replied.

"The administration building is empty for a reason. It's vacancy symbolizes raw potential. Just like a human mind, we could turn that space into whatever we wanted to make it. The students here have that same potential, they can become whatever they want to become. The building is empty on the inside, but we make of it a portal into different planes of existence." 

"That made no sense, sensei".

"I know, little one."

Marth sucked his thumb and rubbed his soft cotton blankey between his fingers. From the tiny fluffy cloud he was sitting on, he could see the big cloud on which the Academy sat.

"Look at all those pillars, mommy!", Marth used a third arm to point.

"Snap out of it, Marth!", Tsuba-sensei was looking at Marth as he lay in the fetal position on the ground of the quarry. "It's the Admirite, it's amplifying your Esper abilities, you need to stay in control of your mind!"
