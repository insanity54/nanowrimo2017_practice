Miyagi Riko sat wearing fuzzy yellow pajamas with legs at her side on the tatami mats of her dorm floor. Needle and thread in hand, she sewed the shoulder seam of a yellow bunny costume atop the room's center chabudai table. Sato Hanna sat in a chair at the side of the room, brushing her hair in front of a well lit vanity mirror.

"Hanna, have you decided who you want on your team this year?" Miyagi asked with sleepy eyes locked on her stitches. 

"I.. hadn't thought of it yet." Hanna replied. Her hand paused for a moment as she looked to her side.

"Really? Every other year you've been dying to get a team together for St. Ezreal's Esperly Order competition." Riko looked up from her craft at Hanna. "Don't tell me you aren't planning on competing this time. You haven't given up, have you?"

"It's not like that. There's just nobody befitting my team." Hanna closed her eyes tightly and continued to brush her hair.

"Oh?" Riko looked on curiously. "It's not good to exclude yourself. You may develop a complex!" She lowered her costume to the table, still holding it.

"Well there is one person, but I don't think he'd join." Hanna spoke in a sad tone, her brush pausing again.

"You don't mean, it's a boy you like?" Riko asked, seeing right through Hanna's secret.

"As-if!" Hanna scoffed, shaking her head. "I've got no time for boys!"

"Your secret's safe with mee!" Riko smiled from ear to ear, picking up her costume and continuing to sew.

Hanna kept her face turned towards the mirror, slowing her brushing. 

"I mean, if I did like someone, he'd probably be tall and handsome, and completely inelligibile for the competition as he'd already be in the Esperly Order. The only boys available are good for nothing perverts!" Hanna slipped out the words, red in her wincing face.

Marth arrived back at the door of his room. As he opened the door to his private supply closet, he let out a sneeze.

"Tchoo!" Marth wiped his nose with his hankerchief. "Summer cold?" He wondered.

Marth's day began at 4:30AM. The sun had yet to rise on the elegant campus, as dew drops formed on the unlit blades of grass. Marth was in blissful dream land, fast asleep on his back, with mouth wide open and a bubble of spit on his lips. 

Tsubasa-sensei kicked in the door.

"On your feet, minion!" The sound of Tsubasa's voice violently rousing Marth from his slumber.

"Ah, I surrender! Take my money and belongings but please leave my Hatsune Miku collection alone!" His spit bubble burst  as Marth sat up in bed and raised his hands in the air.

"You collect Hatsune Miku dolls?" Tsubasa asked, pausing her hostile takeover for a moment.

"They're figures, not dolls!" Marth rubbed the sleep from his eyes, realizing it was just Tsubasa.

"How cute. My niece collects dolls too!" Tsubasa hunched over laughing, revealing a large pack on her back.

Marth threw off his blanket, standing up in t-shirt and shorts.

"Fig-ure-s!" Marth defended his hobby. "What's with the backpack? It looks like you're armed for bear today."

Tsubasa stood up, composing herself and resuming her drill seargent voice. "You've got two minutes to get dressed and rendezvous in the hallway, peon. We're going on a hunt!"
