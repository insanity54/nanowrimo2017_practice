# nanowrimo2017_practice

[NanoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) is a challenge to write a 50,000 word novel in 1 month. This was my practice for that event, to see what the daily workload would be to write 50,000 words in a month. It turned out to be too much for me to handle, while keeping up with work and my other hobbies. Instead, I've decided to write 50,000 words at my own pace, and not participate in the NanoWriMo November challenge.

Each section (example: 001.md) contains approximately 1,666 words. If I can write 30 of these sections, I will have written a novel! (Life achievement unlocked!)
