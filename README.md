Practicing for NanoWriMo 2017 https://nanowrimo.org/

NanoWriMo is a challenge to write a 50,000 word novel in 1 month. This is my practice for that event. The main reason I'm doing this practice is to see what kind of effort would be required to write a novel in one month. My idea is that I would write 1,666 words every day for 30 days. That many words takes me about 3-4 hours.

Each section (example: 001.md) contains approximately 1,666 words. If I can write 30 of these sections, I will have written a novel! (Life achievement unlocked!)
