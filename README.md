# nanowrimo2017_practice

[NanoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) is a challenge to write a 50,000 word novel in 1 month. This was my practice for that event, to see what the daily workload would be to write 50,000 words in a month. It turned out to be too much for me to handle, while keeping up with work and my other hobbies. Instead, I've decided to write 50,000 words at my own pace, and not participate in the NanoWriMo November challenge.

Each section (example: 001.md) contains approximately 1,666 words. If I can write 30 of these sections, I will have written a novel! (Life achievement unlocked!)

A little bit about the genre. It's definately not for everyone. It's a science fiction/fantasy world with mages and espers, mind hacking, strong language and violence. It's chock full of sexually suggestive humor and zany situations. (I'm drawing on years of research of ecchi harem anime. Woot!)

To read the novel as it progresses, check the book out on [gitbook](https://insanity54.gitbooks.io/nanowrimo/content/) Comments can be written in the margins. Constructive critisism is appreciated!
