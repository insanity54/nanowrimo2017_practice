## Story Plot

A mysterious Esper is on campus, spying on St. Ezreal's Academy. The evil esper is using other students as cover, and Marth is framed. The Esper spy uses forbidden projections to look into the future and eavesdrop on staff in secret meetings, among other things.

Marth is suspected as the spy and becomes a prisoner on campus. Things happen and Marth is again framed as the evil esper. The school's administration move to execute Marth as punishment for using the forbidden projections. Luckily Marth has tricks up his sleeve, and help from new friends.

Marth realizes he's being used by an unseen individual, and seeks out to find them. Marth uses Astral methods to find the person, who turns out to be a girl he's already met.

Marth confronts the girl and they duel in the courtyard on unfair terms.

Every Esper has a "thing" (name pending) The "thing" is like the Esper's cutie mark(tm), something that defines that Esper and sets them apart. The first "thing" Marth comes across is the fiery eyes in the administration building
