## Story Plot

A mysterious Esper is on campus, spying on St. Ezreal's Academy. The evil esper is using other students as cover, and Marth is framed. The Esper spy uses forbidden projections to look into the future and eavesdrop on staff in secret meetings, among other things.

Marth is suspected as the spy and becomes a prisoner on campus. Things happen and Marth is again framed as the evil esper. The school's administration move to execute Marth as punishment for using the forbidden projections. Luckily Marth has tricks up his sleeve, and help from new friends.

Marth realizes he's being used by an unseen individual, and seeks out to find them. Marth uses Astral methods to find the person, who turns out to be a girl he's already met.

Marth confronts the girl and they duel in the courtyard on unfair terms.





## Untold tidbits

St. Ezreal is the ancient mage who brought peace between Espers and Mages, the academy formed in his honor.

Every Esper has a "thing" (name pending) The "thing" is like the Esper's cutie mark(tm), something that defines that Esper and sets them apart. The first "thing" Marth comes across is the fiery eyes in the administration building

The evil esper who was using Marth as a proxy had to hide their proxy presence within Marth's mind. They bound the proxy to a ever-present thought in Marth's mind, his attraction to women. Marth has to remove the proxy at some point, and being impatient as he is, he completely removes his attraction to women, thereby removing the proxy. Shit gets awkward as Marth doesn't react to girl's advancements. Maybe he goes gay for a time?? A side effect of the proxy was that Marth's projections would unintentionally target girls he was thinking of.

Tsubasa-sensei sends Marth to the mine whenever she doesn't want to supervise him. There's no risk to the school when Marth is on that plane

### Marth's affinity for women (Astral Realm)

the features quickly changed from natural to man made, opening up to a grand hallway with red carpets. Instead of stalactites, chandeliers hung down from Marble ceilings. The walls and floors were marble too, and the hallway extended further than Marth could even see. Marble walls were plastered with erotic paintings that made Marth drool. A never ending hallway featuring images of lustful women. Was this heaven? 


### Marth the poser

barely avoided detection by posing as an absent student. This cover would only last for so long, but Marth was happy to be a student here, if only for a day.


### Marth’s daydream

Tsubasa-sensei's plan was for me to work in the mine all week. Her plans fell through when I finished that work in one day! She's busy with school today, so I'm as free as a bird! Marth quickly cast Physical Manifestation and created a suit of armor for himself. He trotted into school and found Shiro Neko. "Shiro Neko!" She looked up and puked.

"Do you got a hair ball, Shiro-Neko?" Marth pulled out his hankerchief and wiped ShiroNeko's face, then patted her on the head. "there, there, cutie pie, it'll be ok". Marth knelt down and gently pet ShiroNeko's head as she lay in his lap. 

A look of overjoyement was on Marth's face as ShiroNeko quietly napped there.


### Place cards

The user of a place card can optionally draw their affiliation on the back of the card. Teachers at St. Ezreal's use the Academy's emblem, which cannot be easily reproduced due to it's atomically intricate detail. Some evil esper could perhaps leave behind a place card with no emblem on the back, starting an episode of speculation and fear regarding it's origins among students and staff.

* "They can carried, exchanged, or used by any holder."
* "A projection is 'placed' into the card?" \n "Yes you dumbass." [thanks for explaining the name to the audience]


### Aldo in the infirmirly

"The doctor wasted no time and immediately started cutting Aldo's tattered clothes from his body using a sharp pair of scissors. Marth looked away and walked towards the door"


### Nishi Hotaru the stalker

Niche Hotaru (the evil esper who cast Nemesis of Time via Marth) started following Marth after she realized that Marth had a defense barrier (thanks Aldo.) She gave him binoculars in the cafeteria to get him in trouble, then she followed him to his room when he took a nap. She cuddled in his bed with him (influencing his dreams) before modifying Yoshida-sensei’s place card to make it burn without stopping. At some point, she needs to explain that she was in his room and the one responsible for altering the place card.

### Marth's bed sucks

A new day began and Marth awoke to the sound of footsteps running through the hallways.

"Hurry guys, we're going to be late for school!", Marth whispered, still halfway in a dream.

A moment passed as Marth struggled to open his eyes. Pushing down his blanket, he sat up in his bed of potato sacks. A notch in his back manifested as stretched his arms towards the ceiling.

"Owch! I gotta do something about this dorm situation."



## Astral Projections List

### Remote View

A.K.A. HYPER-DRAGON-EYE

Allows the projector to see/feel things that are physically distant


### Ionic Shock

A spherical blast of electricity. Multiple uses from static shock pranks to tazer-like nervous system interruption to electrocution executions.


### Atomic Relegation

Used to synthesize materials. Marth uses it to create a giant pickaxe, and the school's uniform.


### Pysical Translation

Teleportation. First mention was by Masked Esper on Subject 34 (Aldo)


### Starry Notif

Remote notification method via Place Card. Takes the form of a painting of a stained glass window depicting a shooting star. By default, the place card becomes hot (up to 44 degrees) and lasts for 10 seconds. Place Card exploits apply.


### Astral Inspection

Developed/used by Yoshida-sensei to perform a deep inspection of a person. Does not trigger Astral defense barriers, as it is a read-only operation. Can query muscles in the body, revealing experiences the mind hadn’t perceived. Takes the form of a large green eye on the forehead with actively squiggly eyelashes. 

### Burst of Embers

Pulsating flames. Many uses.


### Place Cards

Not strictly a projection in itself, but a method to store ANY projection which can be traded, or used by the original projector.

#### Tsubasa’s place card magazine

Tsubasa’s combat loadout contains a partitioned pouch of five stacks of cards. Common for all Esper combatants, the cards are used to supplement her own abilities, allowing the Esper to project many times without a toll on their stamina. 

* Stack Position 1 - ??? - A very common attack with multiple uses
* Stack Position 2 - ??? - 
* Stack Position 3 - Burst of Embers - Fire-based pulsating flames
* Stack Position 4 - Blanks - Place cards containing a dud projection. Used for feints. 
* Stack Position 5 - Bubble Shield - Creates a spherical shield from the top down.

Tsubasa uses the Place Card’s second projection slot to store a projection which acts as an initialization function. It can be different for different types of cards, but for Burst of Embers, Burst of Ember’s variables (intensity, delay before unsealing, and duration) are set depending on how Tsubasa throws the card. arm extension equals intensity. speed of finger flick equals delay before unsealing. rotation of wrist twist equals duration of burst.)

## Story Problems

* Astral usage is inconsistent. The admin building for instance. Who's reality is doing what? Is the interior part of the multiverse or is it in someone's astral realm?
* Yoshida-sensei is supposed to be super casual, but she never said her first name when she introduced herself.
* After Aldo wakes up after being put into a coma by Tsubasa-sensei's attack barrier, there is a timeline discrepency.
  * Marth saw Aldo get knocked out, then he goes straight to the cafeteria where Tsubasa-sensei announces The competition's been rescheduled
  * Tsubasa-sensei should be with unconscious Aldo at that time, or busy doing something far away from school.
  * (Maybe she was talking to Keito which is why she didn't show up immediately after Marth RV'd?)
    * In that case, the timeline would be OK. After making the announcement, Tsubasa would go to the infirmiry and everything is on track.
  * The competition being rescheduled needs to happen after some time has passed. Maybe after Keito tells Tsubasa to speed up the trapping process.
* Tsubasa-sensei’s personality keeps changing. Is she a thundre or not? is she a hard ass or not? Is she a masochist or not? Is she in love with Marth or not? (If so, why tf is she?)
