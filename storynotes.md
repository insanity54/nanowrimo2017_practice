## Story Plot

A mysterious Esper is on campus, spying on St. Ezreal's Academy. The evil esper is using other students as cover, and Marth is framed. The Esper spy uses forbidden projections to look into the future and eavesdrop on staff in secret meetings, among other things.

Marth is suspected as the spy and becomes a prisoner on campus. Things happen and Marth is again framed as the evil esper. The school's administration move to execute Marth as punishment for using the forbidden projections. Luckily Marth has tricks up his sleeve, and help from new friends.

Marth realizes he's being used by an unseen individual, and seeks out to find them. Marth uses Astral methods to find the person, who turns out to be a girl he's already met.

Marth confronts the girl and they duel in the courtyard on unfair terms.





## Untold tidbits

St. Ezreal is the ancient mage who brought peace between Espers and Mages, the academy formed in his honor.

Every Esper has a "thing" (name pending) The "thing" is like the Esper's cutie mark(tm), something that defines that Esper and sets them apart. The first "thing" Marth comes across is the fiery eyes in the administration building

The evil esper who was using Marth as a proxy had to hide their proxy presence within Marth's mind. They bound the proxy to a ever-present thought in Marth's mind, his attraction to women. Marth has to remove the proxy at some point, and being impatient as he is, he completely removes his attraction to women, thereby removing the proxy. Shit gets awkward as Marth doesn't react to girl's advancements. Maybe he goes gay for a time?? A side effect of the proxy was that Marth's projections would unintentionally target girls he was thinking of.
