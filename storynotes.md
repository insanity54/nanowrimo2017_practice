## Story Plot

A mysterious Esper is on campus, spying on St. Ezreal's Academy. The evil esper is using other students as cover, and Marth is framed. The Esper spy uses forbidden projections to look into the future and eavesdrop on staff in secret meetings, among other things.

Marth is suspected as the spy and becomes a prisoner on campus. Things happen and Marth is again framed as the evil esper. The school's administration move to execute Marth as punishment for using the forbidden projections. Luckily Marth has tricks up his sleeve, and help from new friends.

Marth realizes he's being used by an unseen individual, and seeks out to find them. Marth uses Astral methods to find the person, who turns out to be a girl he's already met.

Marth confronts the girl and they duel in the courtyard on unfair terms.





## Untold tidbits

St. Ezreal is the ancient mage who brought peace between Espers and Mages, the academy formed in his honor.

Every Esper has a "thing" (name pending) The "thing" is like the Esper's cutie mark(tm), something that defines that Esper and sets them apart. The first "thing" Marth comes across is the fiery eyes in the administration building

The evil esper who was using Marth as a proxy had to hide their proxy presence within Marth's mind. They bound the proxy to a ever-present thought in Marth's mind, his attraction to women. Marth has to remove the proxy at some point, and being impatient as he is, he completely removes his attraction to women, thereby removing the proxy. Shit gets awkward as Marth doesn't react to girl's advancements. Maybe he goes gay for a time?? A side effect of the proxy was that Marth's projections would unintentionally target girls he was thinking of.

Tsubasa-sensei sends Marth to the mine whenever she doesn't want to supervise him. There's no risk to the school when Marth is on that plane

### Marth's affinity for women (Astral Realm)

the features quickly changed from natural to man made, opening up to a grand hallway with red carpets. Instead of stalactites, chandeliers hung down from Marble ceilings. The walls and floors were marble too, and the hallway extended further than Marth could even see. Marble walls were plastered with erotic paintings that made Marth drool. A never ending hallway featuring images of lustful women. Was this heaven? 


### Marth the poser

barely avoided detection by posing as an absent student. This cover would only last for so long, but Marth was happy to be a student here, if only for a day.


### Marthâ€™s daydream

Tsubasa-sensei's plan was for me to work in the mine all week. Her plans fell through when I finished that work in one day! She's busy with school today, so I'm as free as a bird! Marth quickly cast Physical Manifestation and created a suit of armor for himself. He trotted into school and found Shiro Neko. "Shiro Neko!" She looked up and puked.

"Do you got a hair ball, Shiro-Neko?" Marth pulled out his hankerchief and wiped ShiroNeko's face, then patted her on the head. "there, there, cutie pie, it'll be ok". Marth knelt down and gently pet ShiroNeko's head as she lay in his lap. 

A look of overjoyement was on Marth's face as ShiroNeko quietly napped there.


### Place cards

The user of a place card can optionally draw their affiliation on the back of the card. Teachers at St. Ezreal's use the Academy's emblem, which cannot be easily reproduced due to it's atomically intricate detail. Some evil esper could perhaps leave behind a place card with no emblem on the back, starting an episode of speculation and fear regarding it's origins among students and staff.

* "They can carried, exchanged, or used by any holder."
* "A projection is 'placed' into the card?" \n "Yes you dumbass." [thanks for explaining the name to the audience]


### Aldo in the infirmirly

"The doctor wasted no time and immediately started cutting Aldo's tattered clothes from his body using a sharp pair of scissors. Marth looked away and walked towards the door"







## Story Problems

* Astral usage is inconsistent. The admin building for instance. Who's reality is doing what? Is the interior part of the multiverse or is it in someone's astral realm?
* Yoshida-sensei is supposed to be super casual, but she never said her first name when she introduced herself.
