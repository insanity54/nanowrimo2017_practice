"A condition?" Marth wondered.

"Up until the competition, every moment of free time you have, during every waking hour, you must spend practicing your projections."

"Every waking hour?" Marth thought for a minute at what this meant. "You mean you don't want me playing Chess in the lounge? I can handle that."

"I don't want you to study." Tsubasa frankly replied.

"I can't even study?" Marth was shocked at Tsubasa's words.

"We've got no time for classroom material. What you need to learn in our short time before the competition will come straight from me."

"But Tsubasa, there's so many books in the library that could give me an edge." Marth pleaded. "I don't want to limit my chances because I hadn't read up on past competitions. Not to mention the physical strain that projecting non-stop will have on me. Are you trying to wear me out?"

Tsubasa closed her eyes and put a pained look on her face.

"Marth, I know this may not make a lot of sense right now, but I need you to trust me and stick with my plan."

"She wants me to trust her, the ultimate tease?" Marth mumbled to himself.

"Can you do this for me, Marth?" Tsubasa asked.

Marth cloesd his eyes, shrugging his shoulders.

"Well, you are the second pillar of St. Ezreal's. If you say this the way to train, I'll take your word for it."

"Thank you Marth." Tsubasa nodded her head. "I promise this will all make sense soon. Now, before we get to Place Cards, I have to ask. Have you given any thought to who you might want on your team?"

"Well, there are only so many of my peers I've actually had the opportunity to meet, but somehow I think most of them would turn me down."

Shizuma Miyu sat naked on a stool in front of a row of faucets in the girl's bathroom. Her hair was let down to above her shoulders, a contrast from her usual side pony tail.  

Her bare hips and curvy shoulders were quickly drenched by water as she poured a bucket of hat water over her head.

"Ahtchoo!" A sneeze came from Tanaka Aoi, sitting to the left of Shizuma. Naked as well, her thin figure was partially hidden behind her long brown hair.

"Tanaka, hurry up and get washed so you can get in the warm bath. I wouldn't want you to catch a cold!" Shizuma said as she filled another bucket of water.

"I'm fine, I'm fine!" Tanaka closed her eyes as she waved her hand.

Shizuma stood with the bucket of water, pouring it over Tanaka's head as the water covered her body and fell to the floor with a splash.

"Miyu! My hair!" Tanaka covered herself with her arms, with her unplaced shower cap held tightly in her hands.

"Sorry, sorry!" Shizuma took a step back, red in the face as she held the wooden bath bucket against her chest.

"Well, it's too late now. I guess I'll be washing it today." Aoi made the compromise, setting her showercap next to the faucet.

The two girls took turns washing eachother's backs, using a large sponge to scrub suds of soap against their sparkling wet skin.

Marth crouched near the ground, holding out both palms towards  an empty place card sitting in the dirt. A single white colored summoning circle formed a centimeter in front of Marth's hands, containing elements of enclosed trees. The summoning circle slowly rotated, and a second blue summoning circle formed directly atop the card, spinning slowly in the opposite direction. "Resonant Wave, I place within, Emminential Provenance!"

As Marth spoke the words, the two summoning circles accellerated their spin. A cracking sound of elelectricity rang out as an arc spanned the gap between the two circles, transferring to the card as the card let out a bright white light. The summoning circles quickly faded as the light from the card dissipated, leaving behind an imprinted piece of art.

"Congratulations, you've made your first place card." Tsubasa watched over Marth where he crouched.

Marth's stare was locked on his creation, too distracted to regard his teacher's praise. The unique painting shown on the card resembled a rippling pool of water as if disrupted by a dropped steel ball bearing.

Marth picked up the card, holding it in front of him as he inspected the art up close.

"Sensei, how is the art determined? As I sealed the projection within, I had something else in mind." Marth thought back to his mishap with Sato Hanna at the center fountain in the campus yard.

"Nobody knows." Tsubasa crossed her arms as she explained. "There is a belief that some etherial intellect exists in Astral space, and that by creating Emminential Provinence, that consciousness is tapped, and art from it spills out into the card."

"Deep." Marth continued to stare into the card as he flapped it like a bird's wing between his fingers.
