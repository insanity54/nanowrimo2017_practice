The guard re-entered the room, along with another caped Esper. He wore a large brimmed hat and a black blindfold over his eyes. On the fabric, the outline of a single large eye was drawn. As they entered, the glass to the observation room went opaque, tinted dark by a embedded layer of liquid crystal.

The guard and the caped Esper walked up to Subject 34. Still strapped into the chair, the nauseating effects of the Esperin futher affected his body. His head was spinning and he couldn't see straight.

The masked Esper stood by Subject 34's side, holding out his hand and creating a summoning circle on the skin of his palm. The summoning circle separated from his hand, floating a few centimeters outward and increasing in size.

"Please look away.", The mysterious Esper spoke to the guard.

"Ok, but remind me why I've gotta do this every time?", The guard turned his head but kept one eye open.

"As long as you can see him, the subject exists in your personal reality. If I am to transport him from here to D4 in my own reality _and_ that of others, it becomes much more difficult." The masked Esper explained as he kept his focus on his summoning circle.

"Right, right.", the guard closed his open eye.

The floating summoning circle in front of the masked one's palm continued to increased in size until it was as large as 34's body.

"You know, in the Bible, those with sufficient faith were able to move mountains.", The masked Esper said as his summoning circle began to spin.

"Are you saying there were Espers documented in the ancient text?", The guard inquired with his eyes closed.

"Perhaps. And at that time with fewer conscious people on earth, the easier it was to break the rules that those minds imposed on reality." The Esper spoke the words before a wind-line sound violently emanated from his rapidly spinning circle.

"Damn!", the guard cried out, covering his ears to shield from the gusting noise. As he did so, the noise subsided and the room became silent.

The guard peeked open an eye, turning to look at the back of the masked Esper. The summoning circle was gone, and the projector's arms were relaxed at his side. Facing away from the guard, the projector's body blocked the view of the chair. The guard walked up next to the projector to get a better view.

The light shone down from the robotic arm, revealing an empty chair, with it's tough fabric restraining straps still securely fastened. With 34's body no longer present, the waist strap drooped under it's own weight.

"You're pretty good.", the guard laughed, looking up at the masked Esper and patting him on the back.

Subject 34's head was spinning. His laboratory surroundings appeared to be stretched horizontally as if being pulled by a gravity well. The chair he was strapped to was there one moment, then gone after looking away for a split second. He fell on his buttocks, landing on a chalky ground of pulverized concrete.

In his drugged out state, his feeling of exhaustion was fading at the expense of feeling in control of his own faculties. The disorienting pulsing effect of the Esperin matched with the Physical Translation he had just experienced became too much. 34 vomited on the ground amongst the mountains of rubble.

Keeled over with both hands planted in the particulate, the near constant waves of Esperin swept his mind to a degree that could no longer be ignored. A constant ringing in his ears loudened, a noise that hurt. Covering his hears offered no relief, the waves of blue Esperin within his bloodstream the source.

34 cried out, the pain in his head triggering a rage. His muscles in his entire body tensed from the Esperin's pulses resonated within his body. Strained to it's physical capacity, his hair color faded. Feeling an unbearable pressure build up within his body, his gaze shifted to the nearest source of light in the dark.

34 had been transported to the outer fringes of the clan's opposition. The wooden watch tower under the blacked out sky became clear as day as 34's vision was subjugated by the Esperin's power. No longer a pulsing, but a constant deep blue, 34's sight was drastically improved by it's Astral meld. Like a pair of night vision binoculars, 34's vision tunneled on a sole sentry manning the search light.

More animal than human, Subject 34 dashed towards the tower. His sprint, aided by Esperin, let up a cloud of dust as his nimble feet struck the ground stride after stride. Like an explosion of adrenaline, the Esperin fueled his temper, letting out a lustful growl for blood.

The tower sentry noticed the trail of dust, turning their high power spotlight to the aggressor. An alarm was sound as 34's last shred of a conscience faded.

With a powerful thrust of leg muscle power, 34 jumped through the air, over the walled perimeter and up towards the spotlight. The sentry reeled back at the sight, letting go of the spotlight and lifting the rifle slung from around their neck.

The fearful face of the sentry lit up as rapid fire shots burst from his rifle's barrel. 34 flew towards the tower's platform, legs tucked towards his bare chest beneath his buttonless long sleeve shirt. The bullets bounced left and right from a blue projected bubble shield from 34's left hand.

With a hysterical look on his face, his bubble shield met the gun with such force that it was knocked away. His left fist closed, shuttering the projection of the shield. Grappling on with his knees and right hand, 34's momentum threw the sentry off balance and off the tower's platform. Missing the tower's ladder, 34's bodyweight continued to push the man backwards as the man looked up at 34 with terror in his eyes.

Falling down towards the earth, 34's light blonde hair blown back by the wind, 34 lustfully growled for blood. He pushed the helpless sentry away, accelerating his fall to the ground, before projecting a Esperin empowered ball of Ionic Shock towards him. The ball accelerated towards the man who brought up his hands to protect himself, but before the ball made contact, Subject 34 exploded the ball, sending out a shockwave which accelerated the man's descent, and slowed his own.

The man hit the ground with a crack and a thud, instantly killed by the impact. 34 landed on all fours, looking up with a crazed smile. Inside the wall of the outpost, the intruder alarm continued to sound. Militia men, roused from their slumbering, rushed to face the threat.

Subject 34 rose and bolted towards the first man he saw.

"Stop right there!", vapor escaped from his mouth into the cold air as the man yelled. He was armed with a carbine and carried a chest rig full of magazines.

34 didn't stop, he accelerated towards the bearded gunman.

Gunshots and a blast rang out in the night, alerting more of the defenders to 34's position.

A group of militia men came around a corner of wooden shacks among the crumbled city, taking aim at 34. He was standing there, legs shoulder width apart, with hands at the ready. Behind him, the bearded man lay on the ground, killed from another blast of Ionic Shock.

"You're surrounded!", The group of men with guns in hand warned. Their hands shaking at the sight of their fallen comrade. 34 turned to face the group.

"Put your hands up!" The men yelled to 34.

Surrounded by dozens of guns, 34 brought both his hands upwards.

"That's right. Raise them high above your head!", 34 continued raising his hands, but stopped them in front of his bare chest.

"Hands up! Do it now!" The men yelled as the standoff's intensity increased. Rifles aimed at 34 as he held his hands in place. He tilted his head back and his light blonde hair was swept back, revealing a wild smile.

"Open fire!" The men called out, a barrage of bullets breaking out. 34 strained his arm muscles, opening his hands wide and creating two large spheres at the end of each.

The lead flew in, accelerating toward's Subject 34's unshielded body. Meters before making contact, the bullets veered off course, gobbled up by the magnetic field created by his double Ionic Shock. A storm of bullets flew in past the fireballs expelled from the rifle muzzles, each bullet taking a turn away from the intended target and into the spheres of electricity.

The men's mags were emptied, and a moment of silence broke out. Amidst the smoke blown from the guns, Subject 34 stood unscathed, breathing heavily with a crooked grin.

"Reload, reload, reload!", A commanding voice beckoned of his comrades. But it was too late for them, as 34 reversed the polarity of his magnetic field, expelling bullets in all directions. Like the sound of a string of firecrackers, the bullets ripped through the air towards their original source. Simultaneously, the militia men took hundreds of hits, falling backwards as their own bullets did them in.

34 stood alone in the decimated outpost, surrounded only by bodies.

"No mere human can stand against me. I'm INVINCIBLE!", he cried out to the emptiness. As the Esperin's influence faded, he felt the shame at the massacre he had just committed. Covering his face with one hand to hide the tears, he swallowed his guilt, masking his pain with a bout of hysterical laughter.

"For the clan!"

34 collapsed as the compulsory strength from the Esperin diminished.

34 awoke in his cell, along with a long silver haired captive. The captive had a bandage around one eye. Seeing 34 rise, the bandaged captive crawled over.

"I heard you wiped out the human's last outpost." he spoke with a glow in his remaining eye. His excitement got the best of him and he tugged at 34's shirt. His clothes were stained, his body was frail, and his breath stank. "Now all that's left is their main stronghold!"

34 still had sleep in his eyes as he heard the story. He pushed the one eyed man away, angered by his closeness.

"Sorry, sorry.", the man went back to his corner, looking up at 34. "Your hair."

Aldo walked to the door of the cell, looking at himself through his reflection in the glass window.

"Silver."
